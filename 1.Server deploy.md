NOTE: You will be asked for a password when you use the sudo command. This is the password you used when you created the user earlier in this tutorial.
Inside, you need to update two settings:
    - Find PermitRootLogin yes and change it to PermitRootLogin no
    - Find #PasswordAuthentication yes and change it to PasswordAuthentication no
```
sudo systemctl reload sshd
```
